# The "problem" of geography

a map

##

tobler's law


## "Isolation by distance"

definition of genetic distance


## coalescence time

if mutations are Poisson,

P(mut before coal)

= int P(mut before nearby at x) * P(mut before coal | nearby at x) dx


## Wright-Malecot

formula, in 2d

What's sigma eff and Nloc?


## Tracing back lineages

definition of $L_t$

stationary distribution is long-term fitness

motion determines decay of relatedness somehow


# Questions:

Let $\sigma^2_e = \lim_{t \to \infty} \mathbb{E}[L_t^2]$.

What determines the sign of $\sigma_e - \sigma$?

How *does* $L_t$ move, anyhow?


# A discrete model

Discrete space and time,
but varying population sizes.

Goal: understand sources of variation.

(picture of a plant)

## 

Suppose:
$$\begin{aligned}
    N(x,t)
        &= \text{(number of individuals $t$ generations ago at $x$)} \\
    m(x, y)
        &= \text{(proportion of seeds from $x$ that go to $y$)}
\end{aligned}$$

... and surviving individuals are uniform choices out of available seeds.

. . .

and so
$$\begin{aligned}
    \P\{ L_{t+1} = y \;|\; L_t = x \}
        &= \frac{ N(y,t) m(y, x) } { \sum_z N(z,t) m(z, x) } .
\end{aligned}$$



# Big/small worlds

## Much, much simpler:

Assume that:

0. We're in one dimension.
1. $L_t$ is Markov given $N$ (generally requires $N$ to be large).
2. $N(x,t)$ is reversible, Markov, and stationary.
3. $N(x,t) \in \{G, B\}$, with $G \gg B$.
4. $m(x,y) = 1/3$ if $|x-y| \le 1$.

. . .

$$\begin{aligned}
    \text{Note: } \sigma^2 = \frac{2}{2} .
\end{aligned}$$

. . . 

Then $L_{t+1} \; | L_t = x$

- chooses a neighboring "good" patch uniformly, if available;
- if not, chooses a neighboring patch uniformly.


## Case 1: no temporal correlations

Suppose 
- $N(t, \cdot)$ is independent for each $t$, and
- $N(t, x)$ is Markov in $x$ with transition matrix
$$\begin{aligned}
    P = \bordermatrix{  & G & B \cr
                  G & 1-p & p \cr
                  B & q & 1-q \cr
                 }
\end{aligned}$$

---------------------

\begin{tabular}
    habitat    & probability  &  $(\Delta L)^2$ \\
    \hrule
    GGG        &   \frac{p}{p+q} (1-q)^2   & 2/3 \\
    GGB/BGG    &   \frac{p}{p+q} (1-q)q    & 1/2 \\
    GBB/BBG    &   \frac{p}{p+q} q(1-p)    & 1 \\
    GBG        &   \frac{p}{p+q} qp        & 1 \\
    BGB        &   \frac{q}{p+q} pq        & 0 \\
    BBB        &   \frac{q}{p+q} (1-p)^2   & 2/3 \\
\end{tabular}

$$\begin{aligned}
    \E[(L_1 - L_0)^2]
    =
    \frac{2}{3} + \frac{ pq } {3 (p + q) } \left(1 - (p + q)\right) .
\end{aligned}$$

---------------------

$$\begin{aligned}
    \var{L_1} = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{ pq } {3 (p + q) } \left(1 - (p + q)\right) .
\end{aligned}$$
and so
$$\begin{aligned}
    \sigma_e > \sigma \qquad \text{iff} \quad p + q < 1,
\end{aligned}$$

. . .

i.e., iff
- $P$ has only positive eigenvalues.
- the environment does not oscillate.

##

the random environment can *either* slow down *or* speed up a lineage

even with *no* temporal correlations!



# Diffusion limits

Now let's move to *continuous space*.


## The model:

Birth, establishment, and establishment rates
depend on local population densities (like Bolker-Pacala):

- $\eta_t$: point measure of individual locations
- $\theta$: interaction distance
- $\bar \eta_t = p_\theta * \eta_t / N$: rescaled, smoothed population density
- $\gamma(x, \bar \eta_t(x))$: per capita birth rate at $x$
- $q(x, y)$: probability density a juvenile disperses to $y$
- $r(y, \bar \eta_t(y))$: juvenile establishment probability at $y$
- $\mu(x, \bar \eta_t(x))$: death rate at $x$


## For instance

*Mortality increases with crowding:*
$\gamma$ and $r$ are constant,
while
$$\begin{aligned}
    \mu(x, u)
    &= \mu_0 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{1 + \exp(u)} \right) .
\end{aligned}$$

## Or, for instance

*Fecundity decreasing with crowding:*
$\mu$ and $r$ are constant,
while
$$\begin{aligned}
    \gamma(x, u)
    &= \gamma_0 \left( \frac{1}{1 + \exp(u)} \right) .
\end{aligned}$$


## The mean measure

For a test function $f$,
$$\begin{aligned}
    \frac{d}{dt} \E[\int f(x) \bar \eta_t(dx) \;|\; \bar \eta_0 = \bar \eta] \big \vert_{t=0}
    &=
        \theta \int \int f(z) r( )
\end{aligned}$$
