   What's the effect of dispersal? How gene flow depends on ecology.

Abstract:
   How mean genetic relatedness decays across geographic distance is well-known to depend crucially on the "effective dispersal distance", which is the diffusion constant for the motion of a lineage traced back in time from a focal individual. However, little is known about conditions under which the effective dispersal distance is larger or smaller than the (forwards-time) dispersal distance, or more generally, how to describe the motion of a lineage. In this talk, I will discuss several examples in this direction. First, a simple model of discrete space in which effective dispersal may be slower or faster. Next, continuous-space models with local density-dependent population regulation in which the motion of lineages can be described as diffusions driven by the total population process, in the limit of high population density. Work with Alison Etheridge, Tom Kurtz, Ian Letter, Aaron Smith, and Terence Tsui.

Outline:
1. The problem:
  - isolation by distance and Wright-Malecot
  - heuristics: lineages and the decay of W-M with distance
  - heuristics: stationary distributions of lineages and fitness; coalescence
  - motivating question: when is sigma[eff] > sigma? <?

2. Tracing lineages
  - simple discrete model: dispersal, weighted by fecundity (etc)
  - observe that we need large pop density to get a Markov process
  - big-small, Markov world: explicit solutions
 
3. Diffusion limits
  - conditions on theta and N for the forwards density to converge to the solution of a PDE
  - heuristics for the motion of a lineage given the density
  - consequences: how Ne depends on dispersal bias
  - consequences: Ne in the porous media equation
